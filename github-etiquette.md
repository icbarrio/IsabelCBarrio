# GitHub etiquette
- keep names short
- no spaces or funky characters in file names
- remember to pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled
- please include meaningful commit messages that are concise and informative - what did you do? 
- check GitHub tutorial: https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/

I am trying again to see if this works
